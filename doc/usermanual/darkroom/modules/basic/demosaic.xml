	<sect4><title>Usage</title>
                <para>Demosaic is an essential step of any raw image development process.</para>

		<para>A detailed description would be beyond the scope of this manual. In a nutshell, the sensor 
		      cells of a digital camera are only able to record different levels of lightness, not different color. In order 
                      to get a color image, each cell is covered by a color filter, either in red, green or blue.
                      Due to the color sensitivity of the human vision, there are two times more green cells than red or blue.
                      Filters are arranged in a certain mosaic, called Bayer pattern. Therefore each pixel of your image originally 
                      only has information about one color channel. Demosaic reconstructs the missing color channels 
                      by interpolation with data of the neighboring pixels. For further reading see the Wikipedia article on the
                      <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_filter">Bayer filter</ulink>.</para>

		<para>As interpolation is prone to produce artifacts, various different demosaic algorithms have
                      been developed in the past. Artifacts would typically be visible as moir√©-like patterns when you strongly zoom into
                      your image. Currently darktable supports PPG and AMAZE. Both algorithms produce high quality output with a low
                      tendency to artifacts. AMAZE is reported to sometimes give slightly better results. However, as AMAZE is significantly
                      slower, darktable uses PPG as a default.</para>

		<para>Some further parameters of this module can activate additional averaging and smoothing steps. They might help to reduce
                      remaining artifacts in special cases.</para>

		<para>Demosaic is always applied when exporting images. Demosaic is done on monitor display only when zoom is greater than 50% or 
                      when the according preference setting <quote>demosaicing for zoomed out darkroom mode</quote> (see <xref linkend="core_options"/>) 
                      is set accordingly. Else color channels are taken from neighboring pixels without an expensive interpolation.</para>

                <sect5><title>method</title>
			<para>Set the demosaic method. darktable currently supports PPG and AMAZE.</para>
		</sect5>

                <sect5><title>edge threshold</title>
			<para>Set the threshold for an additional median pass. Defaults to <quote>0</quote> which disables median filtering.</para>
		</sect5>	
		<sect5><title>color smoothing</title>
			<para>Activates a number of additional color smoothing passes. Defaults to <quote>off</quote>.</para>
		</sect5>
		<sect5><title>match greens</title>
			<para>In some cameras the green filters have slightly varying properties. This parameter adds an 
                              additional equalization step to suppress artifacts. Available options
                              are <quote>disabled</quote>, <quote>local average</quote>, <quote>full average</quote> and <quote>full and local average</quote>.</para>
