					<entry>This panel provides a powerful functionality in darktable: storing a history stack
                                        as a style, and applying it to other images.
					Styles are created in the darkroom using a button placed below the history panel (see <xref linkend="history"/>).
					They are managed within this lighttable panel, which allows you to apply and delete styles.

		<sect4><title>create duplicate</title>
			<para>When applying a style to selected images, activating this box creates a duplicate of the image before applying the style. 
			      Disable this option if you want to try various styles without creating multiple duplicates.
			</para>
		</sect4>
		<sect4><title>edit</title>
			<para>Styles are a collection of history stack items. After pressing <quote>edit</quote>, you are prompted with a dialogue to include or exclude
                              specific items from the stack. Check option <quote>duplicate</quote> if you want to create a new style, instead of overwriting the existing
                              one; you need to provide a new style name in this case.
			</para>
		</sect4>
		<sect4><title>delete</title>
			<para>This deletes the selected style, without further question.
			</para>
		</sect4>
		<sect4><title>import</title>
			<para>You can import a style which has been previously saved by darktable. darktable stores styles as XML files with the extension <quote>.dtstyle</quote>.
			</para>
		</sect4>
		<sect4><title>export</title>
			<para>This option saves a selected style to disk as a .dtstyle file. This allows sharing styles with other users.
