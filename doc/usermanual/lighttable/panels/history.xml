				<sect4><title>copy</title>
					<para>Copy the history stack of the selected image. You will be prompted for which items are to be include. If more than one image
                                              is selected, the history stack is taken from the image that has been selected first.
					</para>
				</sect4>
				<sect4><title>copy all</title>
					<para>Copy the complete history stack of the first selected image; all items will be included. If more than one image
                                              is selected, the history stack is taken from the image that has been selected first.
					</para>
				</sect4>
				<sect4><title>discard</title>
					<para>Physically delete the history stack of the selected images.
					Beware, this action can not be undone!
					</para>
				</sect4>
				<sect4><title>overwrite/append</title>
					<para>Describes how a new history stack behaves when pasted on an image that already has a
					history stack. <quote>Overwrite</quote> will delete the previous history stack, whereas <quote>append</quote> will concatenate the
					two history stacks.
					</para>
				</sect4>
				<sect4><title>paste</title>
					<para>Paste a previously copied history stack onto all selected images. You will be prompted for which items to include.
                                              This button is greyed out, until a history stack is copied from another image.
					</para>
				</sect4>
				<sect4><title>paste all</title>
					<para>Paste all previously copied items of a history history stack onto all selected images. 
                                              This button is greyed out, until a history stack is copied from another image.

					<para>Opens a dialog box to select an XMP file, thus loading a history stack that you can paste on images.
					</para>
                                        <para>Files that were exported by darktable typically contain the full history stack if the file format supports embedded metadata 
                                              (see <xref linkend="export_selected"/> about this feature and its limitations). You can load an exported image as a 
                                              sidecar file in the same way as you do with an XMP file.
                                              This feature allows you to recover all parameter settings in case you have accidentally lost or overwritten the XMP file. 
                                              All you need is the source image, typically a RAW, and the exported file.

				</sect4>
				<sect4><title>write sidecar files</title>
					<para>Write XMP sidecar files for all selected images. The filename is generated by appending <quote>.xmp</quote> to the name of the underlying
                                              input file.
                                        </para>
                                        <para>By default darktable
                                              generates and updates sidecar files automatically whenever you work on an image and change the history stack. You
                                              can disable automatic sidecar file generation in the preferences dialog (see <xref linkend="core_options"/>). However, this is not
                                              recommended.
