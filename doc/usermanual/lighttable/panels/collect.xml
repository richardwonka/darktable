             <entry>The current view in lighttable is called a collection. With this panel you can manage the collection
                    by filtering with different criteria.

    <para>All images imported into darktable are kept in a database with various attributes describing each image.
    A collection is defined by applying certain filtering rules to these attributes which leads to a subset of your images
    being displayed in the lighttable view.
    </para>

    <para>The default collection is based on the film roll attribute - it displays all images of the last imported film roll or 
    any other film roll chosen.
    </para>

    <para>The left combobox lets you choose from the available attributes:

    <para>In the text field right to the attribute you supply a pattern. The pattern is compared against
    all image's database entries of the selected attribute. A match is detected if the pattern is a substring of
    the image's attribute. You may use <quote>%</quote> as wildcard character.
    The collection gets limited to those images where the query matches. 
    Leaving the text field empty matches all images.
    </para>

    <para>Clicking on the triangle button right to the text field opens a drop-down menu with options to finetune your
    collection by adding further rules:</para>
    <sect4><title>clear this rule</title>
        <para>Removes this rule - or resets to default if this is the only rule defined.
        </para>
    </sect4>
    <sect4><title>narrow down search</title>
        <para>Adds a new rule which is combined with the previous ones in a logical <emphasis>AND</emphasis> operation. An image
        is only part of the collection if it additionally fulfills the added rule.
        </para>
    </sect4>
    <sect4><title>add more images</title>
        <para>Adds a new rule which is combined with the previous ones in a logical <emphasis>OR</emphasis> operation. Images
        that fulfill the new rule are added to the collection.
        </para>
    </sect4>
    <sect4><title>exclude images</title>
        <para>Adds a new rule which is combined with the previous ones in a logical <emphasis>EXCEPT</emphasis> operation.
        Images which are selected by the new rule are exempted from the collection.
        </para>
    </sect4>

    <para>The logical operators defining the combination of rules are displayed right to the rule: <emphasis>AND</emphasis>
    by the <inlinegraphic fileref="&icon_lighttable_and;" scalefit="1" width="2%" align="center" /> symbol, 
    <emphasis>OR</emphasis> by the <inlinegraphic fileref="&icon_lighttable_or;" scalefit="1" width="2%" align="center" /> symbol,
    and <emphasis>EXCEPT</emphasis> by the <inlinegraphic fileref="&icon_lighttable_except;" scalefit="1" width="2%" align="center" /> symbol.
    Clicking on either symbol gives a choice to change the logical operation.
    </para>

    <para>The table below the rules lists all matching database entries of the query you are currently working on. The table 
    gets updated continuously as you type. You may scroll through the list and select the data of your choice by double-clicking.
    </para>
