			<para>Remove the selected images from the darktable database. Those images will not be shown
			in lighttable anymore, but remain on the filesystem. As darktable stores XMP files with your development
                                      parameters on disk, you can later fully reconstruct your work by just re-importing the images. When
                                      backing up your RAWs make sure to also save the XMP files!
			</para>
                        <para><emphasis>Caution: if you are removing an image with duplicates, darktable only keeps an XMP file of the first instance -
                        all other instance's XMP files will be deleted. If you intend to keep them make sure to backup the corresponding XMP files before removing
                        an image.</emphasis>

			<para>Create a high dynamic range image from the selected images, and store it as a new source file in DNG format. Images
                              need to be properly aligned, which implies that they have been taken on a sturdy tripod. You can also 
                              generate HDRs with  programs like <ulink url="http://qtpfsgui.sourceforge.net/"><emphasis>Luminance HDR</emphasis></ulink>, and 
                              later import them into darktable for further processing (see <xref linkend="supported_file_formats"/>).

			<para>Create a virtual copy of selected images within darktable, but not physically on
			your filesystem. It allows testing different developments for the same image, for example. Duplicate images
                                      share the same parent input file, but each have their own .xmp sidecar file.

                        <para>This action will create local copies of the selected images into the local drive. These copies will then be used when the original 
                        images are not accessible (see <xref linkend="local_copies"/>).

                        been modified and the external storage is not accessible the local copy won't be deleted (see <xref linkend="local_copies"/>).
