		 	<para>This panel is for importing images into film rolls. You can either import a complete folder,
      				by pressing <quote>import folder</quote>, or a single image with <quote>import image</quote>. You can also import directly from a connected camera.
		  	</para>

			<para>Imported images are organized as film rolls (see <xref linkend="film_rolls"/>). 
                              All film rolls are accessible through the <emphasis>collect images</emphasis> module (see <xref linkend="collect_images"/>). If you set the selection attribute
                              to <quote>film roll</quote> you get a list of available film rolls, which can be filtered using the editbox to fast find the one of interest.
			      Double-click on a film roll in the list and it will open in the lighttable.
			      You can also click the items in <emphasis>recently used collections</emphasis> (see <xref linkend="recently_used_collections"/>) to open the latest 
                              ones you have worked with.
			</para>

			<sect3 status="final"><title>Import from filesystem</title>
				<para>You can import either a single image, or a folder. If a folder is imported, the images
	                              in that folder will show up in a film roll with the same name as the imported folder. If single images are imported, they
	                              will show up in the film roll called <quote>single images</quote>.
				</para>

                                <para>
                         		<graphic fileref="lighttable/images/panel_import.png" scalefit="1" width="60%" align="center"></graphic>
                                </para>

				<para>Clicking on <quote>import image</quote> or <quote>import folder</quote> opens a file selector dialog. Navigate through the filesystem,
                                      and select the item to import. On the lower part of the dialog, are some further import options. 
                                </para>
                                <para>
                                      As the name implies, checking <quote>import directories recursively</quote> will import images in the currently selected directory, and all 
                                      subdirectories.
                                      It is not recommended, and wastes resources, to do this on an exhaustive list of images. darktable would generate thumbnails for all of them,
                                      but in the end only keep the recent ones in its cache. It is better to import images in smaller chunks, making logical film rolls.
                                </para>
                                <para>Checking <quote>ignore jpeg files</quote> is a good choice if there are JPEG images in the same folder that you do not want to process;
                                      eg. if the camera stores RAW+JPEG, you often only want to work on the RAWs, leaving the JPEG images alone.

                                </para>
                                <para>You can
                                      also apply some metadata during import; see <xref linkend="metadata_editor"/> for more details.
				</para>

				<para>Importing a folder does not mean that darktable copies your images into another folder.
					It just means that the images are visible in lighttable and thus can be developed.
	     				If you delete an image or a folder from disk after having imported them, darktable cannot access them anymore.
		      			Importing an image or folder in darktable is not a backup of your filesystem!
		      			Moreover, darktable does not watch for changes in the filesystem. Thus, if you add an image to a folder,
					after having imported that folder in darktable, the new image will not be shown until explicitly imported.

			<sect3 status="final"><title>Import from camera</title>
				<para>When a camera is detected, it will show up in the device panel. If you hover your mouse over the camera tab label, a tooltip
					will pop up with information about the camera, such as model, firmware version, and more.
				        Depending on the camera's support, buttons with actions will be available such as <quote>import images</quote> and <quote>tethering</quote>.
				</para>
				<sect4><title>Import images</title>
					<para>This will bring up an import dialog, showing the images on camera that can be selected for import into a film roll in
						darktable.
					</para>
				</sect4>
				<sect4><title>Tethering</title>
					<para>Tethering is used to integrate darktable with your camera. While you take images with your camera, they are
						automatically imported into darktable, so you can review the result of the shoot. You can also
						setup remote capture jobs, controlling the number of images and time between captures, along with camera settings such as exposure time, aperture and more.
					</para>
					<para>If supported by your camera, tethering will take you into the capture view for tethered shooting. Read more about tethering in <xref linkend="tethering_chapter"/>.

                        <sect3 status="final" id="supported_file_formats"><title>Supported file formats</title>
                               <para>darktable is focused on managing and developing camera RAW files. It supports a huge number of file formats from various camera manufacturers.
                                     In addition darktable can read specific <emphasis>low dynamic range</emphasis> and <emphasis>high dynamic range</emphasis> images - mainly for 
                                     data exchange between darktable and other software.</para>

                               <para>In order for darktable to consider a file for import, it must have one of the following extensions (case independent): 3FR, ARW, BAY, BMQ, CAP, CINE, CR2, 
                                     CRW, CS1, DC2, DCR, DNG, ERF, FFF, EXR, IA, IIQ, JPEG, JPG, K25, KC2, KDC, MDC, MEF, MOS, MRW, NEF, NRW, ORF, PEF, PFM, PNG, PXN, QTK, RAW, RAW, RDC,
                                     RW1, RW2, SR2, SRF, SRW, STI, TIF, TIFF, X3F.</para>

                               <para>If darktable was compiled with JPEG2000 support, these extensions are also recognized: J2C, J2K, JP2, JPC.</para>

                               <para>If darktable was compiled with GraphicsMagick support, the following extensions are recognized in addition to the standard ones: 
                                     BMP, DCM, GIF, JNG, JPC, JP2, MIFF, MNG, PBM, PGM, PNM, PPM.</para>

					<para>darktable reads RAW files using two open source libraries: RawSpeed (developed by Klaus Post) and - failing that - with LibRaw. The number of supported 
                                              cameras and file formats is constantly increasing. It is beyond the scope of this manual to give an exhaustive list. Most modern camera models 
                                              are supported, and new ones tend to get added very quickly. darktable does not decode images from cameras with non-Bayer sensors (e.g. Fuji X-Pro1 or 
                                              Sigmas with the Foveon X3 sensor).

					<para>darktable natively reads <quote>ordinary</quote> images in JPEG, 8-bit/16-bit PNG and 8-bit/16-bit TIFF format. JPEG2000 is also supported if the

                                              are built into darktable at compile time. Similarly, if darktable was compiled with GraphicsMagick support, there are further import formats,
                                              like GIF, Dicom DCM, additional exotic TIFF formats, and some of Sun's <quote>portable xyz-map</quote> family.
