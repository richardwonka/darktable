							<entry>The current view in lighttable is called a collection. With this panel, you can manage the collection
							by filtering with various criteria.
							The left combo box lets you choose from different filters, such as <quote>filmroll</quote>,
                                                        <quote>history stack</quote>, <quote>date</quote>, <quote>camera</quote> and much more. The table below the combobox lists 
                                                        all available data for the selected filter. You can then select the data of your choice by double-clicking.
