               <para>Grouping images helps improve structure and clarity of your image collection when 
                     displayed in lighttable view.
               </para>

               <para>You can combine images into a group by selecting them, and  
                     clicking the <quote>group</quote> button in the <emphasis>selected image(s)</emphasis> panel (<xref linkend="selected_images"/>), or by typing 
                     <emphasis>ctrl-g</emphasis>. Likewise, you can remove selected images from a group by clicking
                     the <quote>ungroup</quote> button, or typing <emphasis>shift-ctrl-g</emphasis>. Images generated by 
                     duplicating an existing one, are automatically grouped. If you import 
                     images from the file system or camera, images with the same base name, but different 
                     extensions (eg. IMG_1234.CR2 and IMG_1234.JPG), will form a group.
               </para>

                                        <entry><para>Images which are members of a group are labeled with a <quote>G</quote> symbol in their thumbnails.</para>

               </para>
 
               <para>The group button <inlinegraphic  fileref="images/lighttable_icon_group.png" scalefit="1" width="2%"/> 
                     in the top panel of the lightroom view toggles grouping mode on and off.
                     If grouping is off, each image is displayed as an individual thumb.
                     If grouping is on, images of a group are collapsed, which means they are 
                     represented by one thumbnail.
                     The image you see is called the group head. If you press <quote>G</quote> symbol in the thumbnail of a group, only this
                     group gets expanded; if another group was expanded at that time, it gets collapsed. To collapse an expanded 
                     group again, just click on the <quote>G</quote> symbol of its group head.
               </para>

               </para>

               <para>You can define which image constitutes the group head, while in an expanded view of a group, 
                     clicking on the <quote>G</quote> symbol of the desired image.
               </para>

               <para>If you are in collapsed view, and enter darkroom mode with an image group (eg. by 
                     double-clicking on the thumbnail), only the group head will be opened.
               </para>

               <para>Image groups are a convenient way to protect an existing history stack against unintentional changes. Suppose you have 
                     just finalized an image; all you need to do now is generate a duplicate, make sure grouping is
                     switched on, and the group collapsed. Whenever you open the image group again in darkroom, 
                     only the group head will be altered. The underlying duplicate remains unchanged. 
                     Please note that duplicating images only means that a second copy of your history stack, and a second small 
                     XMP file, is generated. There still is only one RAW file, so you don't waste a lot of disk space.
