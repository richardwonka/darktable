						<entry>Camera sensors provide data in linear RGB format, the original image appears flat and dull.
                                                       That's the reason why camera manufacturers apply their characteristic base curves to the RAW data
                                                       when they generate in-camera JPEG images with better colors and contrast.
                                                       darktable comes with base curve presets that mimic the curves of various manufacturers. 
                                                       These are automatically applied to RAW images according to the manufacturer ID found in EXIF data.

	<sect4><title>Usage</title>
		<para>You can adjust an existing base curve or create a new one. The base curve is defined by two or more nodes. You can click on any node and drag to 
                      modify it. You can also create additional nodes by clicking on a curve segment between two nodes. In order to remove a node drag it outside of the 
                      widget area.
                </para>

                <para>Tip: If you intend to take full manual control of the tonal values with the <emphasis>tone curve</emphasis> module or the <emphasis>zone system</emphasis>
                      module (see <xref linkend="tone_curve"/> and <xref linkend="zone_system"/>) it may be easier to leave the image in
                      linear RGB. Disable the <emphasis>base curve</emphasis> module in this case.
