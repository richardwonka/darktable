		<para>darktable is a non-destructive image editor. This implies that darktable opens input images read-only. Any newly added metadata, tags and
                parameters of image operations (history stack) are stored in a separate file, a so called sidecar or XMP file. When you import an input image into
                darktable for the first time an XMP file with default settings is generated automatically.
                </para>
                <para>For a given source image multiple edits, called duplicates, can co-exist - sharing the same input (RAW) data but each having their individual
                set of metadata, tags and history stack. Each duplicate is represented by a separate XMP sidecar file with a filename constructed in the form 
                <quote>&lt;basename&gt;<emphasis>_nn</emphasis>.&lt;extension&gt;.xmp</quote>, where <emphasis>nn</emphasis> represents the (minimum two digit)
                version number of that edit. The initial edit - the duplicate with version number zero - is represented by sidecar file <quote>&lt;basename&gt;.&lt;extension&gt;.xmp</quote>.
                The version number of a duplicate is displayed in the image information panel in each of darktable's views
                (see for example <xref linkend="image_information"/>).
                </para>
                <para>
                Sidecar files get synchronized automatically by darktable without the need to press a <quote>save</quote> button.
                When backing up your data, make sure you also keep the XMP files, as these are needed to fully reconstruct your work in case of a disaster.
                </para>
                <para>In addition to the sidecar files darktable keeps all image related data in its database for fast access. An image can only be viewed and edited from within
                darktable if its data is loaded in that database. This automatically happens when you first import an image or at any later time by re-importing it (see <xref linkend="import"/>).
                In the latter case the database gets updated with data that darktable finds in the sidecar files belonging to that image.
