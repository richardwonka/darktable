            <entry>This module offers an easy to use and - at the same time - highly efficient denoise operation. Under the hood
            it applies (your choice of) a non-local means or edge-aware wavelet denoise algorithm with parameters specifically profiled for certain
            camera models and ISO settings.

  <sect4><title>Usage</title>
                <para>The darktable team, with the help of many users, has measured noise profiles for various cameras. Differentiated by ISO settings
                      we evaluated how the noise statistics develop with brightness for the three color channels. Our set of profiles already covers about 100 popular 
                      camera models from all major manufacturers.</para>
    <sect5><title>profile</title>
      <para>Based on EXIF data of your RAW file, darktable will automatically determine the camera model and ISO setting. If found in its database,
                              the corresponding noise profile will be used. If your image has an intermediate ISO value, the statistical properties
                              will be interpolated between the two closest datasets in the database, and this interpolated setting will show up
                              as the first line in the combo box. You also have the option to manually overwrite this selection to suit your personal preferences better.
                              The top-most entry in the combo box brings you back to the profile darktable deems most suited.</para>

    <sect5><title>mode</title>
      <para>This module can eliminate noise with two different core algorithms. <quote>non-local means</quote> is a bit better suited to tackle luma (lightness) noise; <quote>
                              wavelet</quote> has its strength in eliminating chroma (color) noise. If needed you can apply two instances of this module (see <xref linkend="multiple_instances"/>).
                              The <quote>non-local means</quote> instance should be combined with blend mode <quote>lightness</quote> or <quote>HSV lightness</quote>; 
                              the <quote>wavelet</quote> instance with blend mode <quote>color</quote> or <quote>HSV color</quote>. 
                              For more information on blend modes have a look at <xref linkend="blending_operators"/>.</para>
    </sect5>
    <sect5><title>patch size</title>
      <para>This slider is only available if mode <quote>non-local means</quote> is selected. It controls the size of the patches being matched
                              when deciding which pixels to average (see also <xref linkend="denoise_non_local_means"/>). Setting this to higher values can give more sharpness.
                              Processing time will stay about the same.</para>
    </sect5>
    <sect5><title>strength</title>
      <para>This parameter is here to fine-tune the strength of the denoise effect. The default value has been chosen to maximize the peak signal to noise ratio.
            It's mostly a matter of taste if you prefer a rather low noise level at the costs of
            a higher loss of detail, or if you accept more remaining noise in order to have finer structures better preserved within your image.</para>
