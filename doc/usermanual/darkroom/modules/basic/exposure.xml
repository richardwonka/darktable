						<entry>This module is used to tweak the exposure.
							It is directly linked to the histogram panel. Indeed, if you correct exposure graphically, using the <emphasis>histogram
                                                        </emphasis> (see <xref linkend="histogram"/>),
							you automatically activate the exposure module. The histogram simply acts as a view for the exposure module.

                <para>You can activate multiple instances of this module each with different parameters acting on different parts of the image which you select by
                      drawn masks (see <xref linkend="multiple_instances"/> and <xref linkend="drawn_masks"/>). The histogram is always linked
                      to the lowest instance in pixelpipe.

	<sect4><title>Usage</title>
                <para>This module is responsible for one of the most basic steps in each raw image development. An exposure adjustment value allows you - within certain limits - to
                      correct for under- or overexposure. A shift by 1EV is equivalent to a change of exposure time by a factor of 2.
		</para>
		<para>Positive exposure corrections will make the image brighter. As a side effect noise level gets higher. Depending on the basic noise level of your
                      camera and the ISO value of your image, positive exposure compensations with up to 1EV or 2EV still give reasonable results.
		</para>
		<para>Negative exposure corrections will make the image darker. Given the nature of digital images this can not correct for blown out highlights (see
                      also <xref linkend="highlight_reconstruction"/>).
		</para>
		<para>A black level adjustment is a basic tool to increase contrast and pop of an image. The value defines at what threshold dark gray values are
                      cut off to pure black. Use with care as the clipped values can not be recovered in other modules further down the pixelpipe. Please also have a look
                      at the <emphasis>tone curve</emphasis> module (see <xref linkend="tone_curve"/>) and the <emphasis>levels</emphasis> module (see <xref linkend="levels"/>)
                      which can produce similar results with less side effects as they come later in pixelpipe.

                              An adjustment slider right to the auto exposure checkbox lets you define what percentage of bright values are to be clipped out in the calculation.
