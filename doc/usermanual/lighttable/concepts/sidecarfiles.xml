		<para>darktable is a non-destructive image editor. This implies that darktable opens input images read-only. Any newly added metadata, tags and
                parameters of image operations are stored in a separate file, a so called sidecar or XMP file.
                Each input image has its own sidecar file residing in the same
                folder as the input file with a filename constructed in the form <quote>&lt;basename&gt;.&lt;extension&gt;.xmp</quote>. 
                Sidecar files get synchronized automatically by darktable without the need to press a <quote>save</quote> button.
                When backing up your data, make sure you also save the XMP file, as this is needed to fully reconstruct your work in case of a disaster.
                </para>
                <para>In addition to the sidecar files darktable keeps all image related data in its database for fast access.
