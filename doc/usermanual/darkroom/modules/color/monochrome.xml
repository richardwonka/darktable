						<entry>This module is a quick way to convert an image into black and white and provides a variable
                                                       color filter for that conversion.

	<sect4><title>Usage</title>
		<para>The default central location of the filter has a neutral effect but dragging it to an alternate position applies
                      a filter analogously to taking a b&amp;w photograph through a conventional color filter.
		</para>

                <para>As well as position you can change the filter size by scrolling with your mouse wheel. This makes the filter's range of hues
                      more or less selective.
                </para>

                <para>Tip: First reduce the filter size to concentrate its effect and move it across the hue pallet to find the best filter value
                      for your desired image rendition. Then expand the filter to include more hues and thus more natural tonality.
