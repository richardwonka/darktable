						<entry>This module is a classic digital photography tool. Unlike other image manipulation software, however, darktable's tone curve
                                                acts in Lab color space. Thus, it offers three independent curves for L, a, and b channels.

	<sect4><title>Usage</title>
		<para>In its default state, curves will be straight lines, defined by few anchor nodes. You can move the nodes with your mouse
                      to modify the curve. You can also generate new nodes by clicking on the curve. Up to 20 nodes per curve can be defined.
                      To remove a node, move it out of the widget area. A color picker is activated by pressing 
                      <inlinegraphic fileref="&icon_module_picker;" scalefit="1" width="2%" align="center" /> and will show the picked values in
                      the graph. Numerical Lab values of input and output (see below) at the selected spot are shown on top left of the
                      widget.
		</para>
		<sect5><title>L-channel curve</title>
			<para>The tone curve in L-channel works on Lightness. For a better overview a lightness histogram is displayed in the
                              diagram.
                        </para>
                        <para>
                              The horizontal line represents the input image pixels' lightness. The vertical line represents the 
                              lightness of the output image pixels. A straight line does not change anything. 
                              A point above the default diagonal increases the lightness, whereas a point under decreases it. Shifting the center
                              of the curve upwards will lighten the image, shifting it downwards will darken the image. An S-like curve will
                              enhance the contrast of the image.
                       </para>
		</sect5>
		<sect5><title>a/b-channel curves</title>
			<para>The curves in the a and b channels work on color values. They are only displayed and active if the
                              <emphasis>scale chroma</emphasis> combobox is set to <quote>manual</quote>.
                              The horizontal line represents the color channel value of the input image pixels. The vertical line
                              represents the color channel value of the output image pixels. Positive a-values correspond to more magenta colors;
                              negative a-values correspond to more greenish colors. Positive b-values correspond to more yellowish colors; negative
                              b-values correspond to more blueish colors. 
                        </para>
                        <para>A straight line does not change anything.
                             Shifting the center of the curve will give the image a color tint: shifting a-channel upwards gives a magenta tint;
                             shifting b-channel upwards gives a yellow tint; shifting a-channel downwards gives a green tint; shifting
                             b-channel downwards gives a blue tint.
                        </para>
                        <para>Increasing/decreasing the steepness of the curves, without shifting its center, will increase/decrease the color 
                             saturation of the respective channel. With properly defined curves you can exert fine control on color saturation,
                             depending on the input pixel's colors.
                        </para>
		</sect5>	
		<sect5><title>scale chroma</title>
			<para>darktable does an automatic adjustment of color saturation, if this combobox is set to <quote>auto</quote>. The level of this
                              adjustment depends on the pixel's color values and its L-value modification by the L-channel tone curve. It is
                              designed to give an overall boost in color saturation, if the L-curve gives a contrast boost. Look at blend mode
                              <quote>coloradjustment</quote> to adjust the strength of this effect (see <xref linkend="blending_operators"/>). If this 
                              combobox is set to <quote>manual</quote>, you can modify color saturation using the curves in channels a and b.
