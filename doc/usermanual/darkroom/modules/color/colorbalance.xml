	<sect3><title>Usage</title>
		<para>For each of the three primary colors - red, green, and blue - there are three sliders <quote>lift</quote>, <quote>gamma</quote> and <quote>gain</quote> 
                      to control dark tones, mid tones and high tones, respectively. Changing these parameters adds offsets to the individual
                      RGB channels and influences the color balance of the image.</para>

                <para>Additional <quote>factor</quote> sliders act on all colors at once. Their effect is similar to the controls of the
                      <emphasis>levels</emphasis> module (see <xref linkend="levels"/>).</para>

                <para>The way to best envision the module's way of working is if you consider <quote>lift</quote>, <quote>gamma</quote> and <quote>gain</quote>
                      as parameters influencing the properties of a tone curve which - in its original state - is a straight line going diagonally from 
                      bottom left to top right.</para>

                <para>The lift parameter adjusts the left axis intercept of the line - the intercept can be shifted from its default zero value to negative or 
                      positive values. The gamma parameter modifies the line shape - the default shape is linear and can be turned into a convex curve with increased or into
                      a concave curve with lowered gamma values. Finally, the gain parameter defines the steepness of the curve - by default the curve runs
                      diagonally, higher values lead to a steeper curve and lower values to a flatter one.</para>

                <para>Side note: although this module acts on RGB colors its location in pixelpipe puts it into the Lab color space. Accordingly the modules converts
                      from Lab to RGB, does its color adjustments, and then converts back to Lab.</para>
