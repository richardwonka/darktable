        <sect4>
                <para>Banding is a problem which can arise, when an image is downsampled into a lower bit-depth. Downsampling happens regularly,
                      when darktable displays or exports the results of a pixelpipe. In order to avoid banding, you may activate this modules.</para>  

                <para>If you export images with a reduced width/height and want best dithering results, please make sure that you de-activate option <quote>do high 
                      quality resampling during export</quote> in <emphasis>core options</emphasis> (see <xref linkend="core_options"/>), else the final scaling step will 
                      counteract dithering.</para>

                <para>Viewing from some distance an image dithered into a very low bit depth (like <quote>floyd-steinberg 1-bit b&amp;w</quote>) will give the impression of 
                      a homogeneous grayscale image. We try to mimic this impression in darktable when you look at zoomed-out images in the center 
                      view, in the navigation window and for thumbnails. This is accomplished by dithering those images into a higher number of grayscale levels. 
                      Note that as a consequence the histogram - which is derived from the navigation window - will show this increased number of levels and is no longer
                      a full match of the output image.</para>

	<sect4><title>Usage</title>
		<sect5><title>method</title>
			<para>This combobox sets the dithering method. Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion - with some typical output bit depths - and random noise 
                        dithering are both supported. Floyd-Steinberg systematically distributes quantization errors over neighboring pixels, whereas random dithering just adds some
                        level of randomness to break sharp tonal value bands. The default setting is <quote>floyd-steinberg auto</quote>, which automatically adapts
                        to the desired output format.</para>
		</sect5>

		<sect5><title>damping</title>
			<para>This slider is only displayed if you choose method <quote>random</quote>. It controls the level of added random noise expressed as a damping factor in a
                              10*log<subscript>2</subscript> basis. A value of -80 is a good fit for 8-bit output formats and -160 for 16-bit ones.</para>
