	<para>Darkroom mode is for photograpic development of the image you selected from the lighttable. Lots of tools, named
        modules, are available for processing that image.
	</para>
	<para>On the left hand side you have navigation, snapshot, history and masks manager panels, described in <xref linkend="darkroom_panels"/>. 
	In the right hand panel you can see the histogram and a list of modules available for working with the image. 
	At the bottom of the right hand panel you can enable/disable view of individual modules.
	</para>

	<para>You can use <emphasis>middle-click</emphasis> to zoom 1:1. A double <emphasis>middle-click</emphasis> takes you to 2:1. Alternatively you can
        zoom in and out between 1:1 and fit-to-screen by mouse scrolling. Mouse scrolling while holding the control key pressed gives an extended zoom range 
        between 2:1 and 1:10.
	</para>

	<para>You normally export multiple images from the lighttable view but you can also export the current image directly from the darkroom by using 
        the shortcut <emphasis>ctrl-e</emphasis>. Export parameters are then those currently selected in the lighttable.</para>

        <para>The optional filmstrip can be used to quickly switch between images while remaining in the darkroom view. The images viewed are the same
		as the ones in the lighttable view.
	</para>
	<para>The filmstrip can be switched on and off using the shortcut <emphasis>ctrl-f</emphasis>. You can scroll with your mouse to quickly navigate
              through the images and change the height of the filmstrip panel by dragging its top.</para>
